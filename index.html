<p>Our app is designed to be used by people with physical disabilities if they want it. It will be easy for them to order like anyone a taxi by specifying if they need a special car (for the wheelchair) or not</p>

<p>Released as a mobile app and as a phone line you will be able to order a taxi even if you don't have a smartphone.
We're making the connection between you and the taxi service you'd like to use (Easytaxi, Uber, etc.)</p>

<p>When you order a car without being disabled people, you can at the end of your order, decide how you split up the fare between, Handy-Taxi, taxi/chauffeur service and our donation feature. If you decide to put money in the donation feature, each time someone with a physical disability use our app to travel, his fare will be lower.</p>
