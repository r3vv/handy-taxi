{"name":"Handy Taxi","tagline":"Designed for everyone, even if you have a wheelchair","body":"### Not like the other taxis services\r\nOur app is designed to be used by people with physical disabilities if they want it. It will be easy for them to order like anyone a taxi by specifying if they need a special car (for the wheelchair) or not\r\n\r\n### The bridge between users and taxis/chauffeurs services\r\nReleased as a mobile app and as a phone line you will be able to order a taxi even if you don't have a smartphone.\r\nWe're making the connection between you and the taxi service you'd like to use (Easytaxi, Uber, etc.)\r\n\r\n### Our little plus\r\nWhen you order a car without being disabled people, you can at the end of your order, decide how you split up the fare between, Handy-Taxi, taxi/chauffeur service and our donation feature. If you decide to put money in the donation feature, each time someone with a physical disability use our app to travel, his fare will be lower.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nJose Luis Toledo Medina\r\nRicardo Patricio Gutierrez Garcia\r\nCarlos Eduardo Villalobos Castro\r\nAna Paula Vega Neuenschwander\r\nDiego Juan Medjdoub\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
